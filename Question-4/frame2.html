      <h1>Topic 1: Covid-19 and its variants</h1>

      <p>
        This topic covers the COVID-19 pandemic and its variants. COVID-19,
        caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is a highly contagious respiratory
        illness that emerged in late 2019 and rapidly spread across the world,
        leading to a global pandemic. The virus has undergone mutations,
        resulting in different variants with varying degrees of transmissibility
        and severity. Understanding these variants is crucial for public health
        officials and researchers to adapt vaccination and mitigation
        strategies.
